    "- Follow the initial steps exactly as in cohort 9 to train your first model\n",
    "- evaluate the model using an appropriate metric. Indicate all data of the trained model together with the error through your chosen error function. Visulize the trained model with maybe types of graph\n",
    "- Take steps to improve your model. Try to search online. One way is to vary the iterations and learning rate. Train a few times, then choose the model with the best accuracy.\n",

    "#### Step 3 Prediction:\n",
    "Now that you have your trained model, you need to find a way to predict the crop type that gives the highest yield. Recall that the above model predicts highest yield for any given crop type. So what you would do is create a function where the user types in everything except for crop type, and you would go on to predict yield for every crop type with the inputted variables. After which you will choose the crop type with the highest yield and return it \n"
